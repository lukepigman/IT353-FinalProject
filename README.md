# IT353-FinalProject - LinkedU

LinkedU is a website aimed at connecting high school students to prospective colleges.

To create LinkedU, we used HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and PrimeFaces to create the site, and JSF to link our front end to a derbyDB that we created.
The site features the ability to create and manage an account as either a student or as a university. There are also admin priveleges that 
allow LinkedU owners to highlight universities that request more exposure.
